# Wanchai Verts/Points residual: independently confirmed, but its UNATCO causal story is owner-invalidated

Re-derived directly from `_scratch/wanchai-relight-2026-08-29/{native,golden}.dx` (2026-08-29, current
tree, node/surf-exact per `feeaa21`): native 16807 points / 167325 verts vs golden 16791 points /
169313 verts — native +16 points, **−1988 verts** (−1.2%). Confirms an external report's claim.

That report also called this "a known, already-diagnosed issue" matching UNATCO's residual
(`unatco-verts-points-residual-after-the-zone`: ~209 unported `csgRebuild` sub-BSP repartition calls,
`sub_49380`). Do not cite that as settled: `owner-ruling-all-native-decode-spike-findings` (ruled
2026-08-28) names this exact mechanism as "diagnosed ONLY from the old spikes → not portable from the
written spec; must be re-pinned from fresh live capture before any port" — despite the item itself
being committed 2026-08-26, its causal chain traces back to the invalidated pre-2026-08-14
disassembly. The Wanchai number above is a real, confirmed measurement; the "same missing feature"
explanation for it is not yet established.
